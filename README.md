The main goal of Smart Health Care System is to design a project that will improve patient care and reduce the expense of running a hospital. It aids in the registration of complete patient data, records and retains the patient’s medical history, treatment needs, past visit details, planned appointments, reports, insurance information, and more.
It might have happened so many times that you or someone yours need doctors help immediately, but they are not available due to some reason. The Health Prediction application is an end user support and online consultation project. Here we propose a web application that allows users to get instant guidance on their health issues through an intelligent health care application online. The application is fed with various symptoms and the disease/illness associated with those systems. The application allows user to share their symptoms and issues. It then processes user’s symptoms to check for various illness that could be associated with it. Here we use some intelligent data mining techniques to guess the most accurate illness that could be associated with patient’s symptoms
